# `EthCLSpecs.Proofs`: consensus-spec theorems (index)

Mathlib-free proofs about `EthCLSpecs` declarations, colocated with the specs
the way `SizzLean.Proofs` is colocated with `SizzLean`: same package, same
build. Each theorem is closed by whichever tactic its goal needs, `bv_decide`,
`decide`, `native_decide`, or plain case analysis. Always over the spec's own
types, never mathlib. A theorem that turns out to need mathlib moves to the standalone
`EthCLProofs` package instead (`docs/SPECS_ARCHITECTURE.md` §11), following the
`LeanPoseidonProofs` containment pattern. Mathlib never reaches this library,
the framework, the runner, or the conformance path.

Re-exports:

* `EthCLSpecs.Proofs.BuilderIndex`: the builder-index flag round-trip
  (`isBuilderIndex`, `toBuilderIndex`, `convertBuilderIndexToValidatorIndex`).
* `EthCLSpecs.Proofs.InitializePtcWindow`: the seeded `ptcWindow`'s two
  regions (`initializePtcWindow`).
* `EthCLSpecs.Proofs.UpdateCheckpoints`: `Gloas.updateCheckpoints` checkpoint
  monotonicity, the justified/finalized epoch never decreases. Its theorems sit
  in `EthCLSpecs.Proofs.Gloas`, since `updateCheckpoints` exists in both forks.
